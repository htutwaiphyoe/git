# Introduction to Git & Github

To save all historical versions of the same document like Microsoft Word, multiple files with different names must be needed. Using those different versions of the file, we can get back specific version and travel in time with it. With Git, it takes care all itself. It stores every historical version of every file automatically.

## Git vs Github

Git and Github are two completely different things.

Git is distributed version-control system. It tracks changes in files in a folder called **repository**. It preserves history of all the changes in files. Git has own file structures. Every file is stored in a separated document and has unique hash. It is simply persistent hash map that stores key-value pairs. Key is a hash and value is content of the file. Git could be used locally without internet and had full access to entire history of all changes in repository. It stores all changes **locally**.

Github is repository hosting service. It helps to manage git repositories and is used to collaborate with other people on same project. It is also useful for backup of local repositories. But Github is primarily used by distributed teams working on the same projects. Github has other features like Github Hosting Services.
